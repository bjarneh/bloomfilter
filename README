[ What ]

A small bloomfilter for golang. This is a negative filter,
i.e. it can verify quickly with 100% certainty that some
word (string) is not present, assuming that all words have
been added to the bloomfilter naturally :-)


[ Install ]

goinstall github.com/bjarneh/bloomfilter


[ Example ]

<code>

filter := bloomfilter.New() // or NewSize( size int ) 

filter.Add("plenty")
filter.Add("of")
filter.Add("words")


if ! filter.Marked("word") {
    println("'word' is not present")
} else {
    println("'word' could be present")
}

</code>
